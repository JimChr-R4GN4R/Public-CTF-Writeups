## Solution

I attempted this challenge as the final challenge to all-kill solves, because it had no prior solves. 

I downloaded the image, looked briefly into it.

First things first,

```
$ file cute_kittens.jpg
cute_kittens.png: PNG image data, 480 x 330, 8-bit/color RGB, non-interlaced
```

Interestingly enough, the file extension was `.jpg` but the contents were 

```
00000000  89 50 4e 47 0d 0a 1a 0a  00 00 00 0d 49 48 44 52  |.PNG........IHDR|
````

I tried to dump LSB, MSB and manually inspected image bytes. Nothing particular stood out.

Afterwards, I went to scout for visually similar image to the challenge provided.

```
File Type                       : PNG
File Type Extension             : png
MIME Type                       : image/png
Image Width                     : 480
Image Height                    : 330
Bit Depth                       : 8
Color Type                      : RGB
Compression                     : Deflate/Inflate
Filter                          : Adaptive
Interlace                       : Noninterlaced
Image Size                      : 480x330
Megapixels                      : 0.158
```

Following are the attributes, the file size of the image was 189kB. At this point, I found some images which were visually similar with same dimensions - although there were JPEG. All of them.

For instance, I downloaded 2 of the original images


```
â‡’  ls | grep cute
cute_kittens.png
cute_kittens.zip
cute_kittens_original.jpg
cute_kittens_original1.jpg
```


Both of them were ~40Kb. The size of the file was roughly 4 times more than the original image. Also, the lack of availibility of the native png for the visually similar image was a big red flag for me. That being said, I knew that this is for sure a steganography challenge. More likely the ones which have embed data.

Now, I tried basic steganography tools over it. No success that way. There are a hell lot of tools, and finding the one which author used is not a simple task. 

I thought something smart by that point. I thought after downloading the jpg, the author ran some stego tool on it and it embed flag in original file and author forgot to change extension. The challenge being supplied with `.jpg` was a good indication.

The stego algorithm might have changed file data
But author might have done something like

```
$ ./tool -in original.jpg -out cute_kittens.jpg
```

Now, that I intuitively had figured out this plausible reason, I lowered down the complexity to search stegano tools. 

Within no time, I found [Stegify](https://github.com/DimitarPetrov/stegify), which had same stego generation mechanism which I anticipated.

Next, 

```
â‡’  go run stegify.go -op decode -carrier cute_kittens.png -result solve.png
```

```
â‡’  file solve.png
solve.png: Zip archive data, at least v?[0x30a] to extract
```

Then,

```
hexdump -C solve.png
