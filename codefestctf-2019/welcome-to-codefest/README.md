## Solution

I got half of the flag when joining the telegram channel, then there was a pinned message indicating the other half was on the challenge page.

I tried doing image analysis on the images, poster, etc. and also looked at DOM carefully with no success.

Thereafter, the next idea was to search in the wayback archive.
